## Hierarchy and Contrast
At the end of the day, design is all about creating hierarchy and contrast. The design decision we make non-verbally communicate to our readers and users on what to expect, what we want them to read, and how we want them to read it.

* **White space is your friend** <br>
It draws more attention to what is present. <br>

* **Prioritize the elements on your page and make the most important stand out more than the rest.** <br>

## Color Theory
* **Use high contrast between colors**<br>
Consider a wider audience! A significant number of the population are color blind. Using high contrast colors helps _everyone_ read the content on your site.

  * [Test background and foreground text color](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)

* **Code fall-backs into color** <br>
If you decide to code a color with `rgba()`, include a fall-back above it which is a solid `rgb()` value for older browsers that can't read `rgba()`: <br>
  `color: rgb(12,15,134);`
  `color: rgba(12,15,134,.6);`

## Typography
Ask most web designers and they'll agree with the old web design quote "95% of web design is typography". It _is_ that important in web design

* **Include line-height on all typographic elements**<br> `line-height` can completely change your site. Headlines should have a `line-height` of at least `1.2` or `1.3` and body copy (paragraphs and long reads) should have a `line-height` of at least `1.6` or `1.7`. <br>
`line-height: 1.6` can be applied to `body` css and then changed only when needed on individual type styles. <br>

* **Let the website design carry the tone, and pick typefaces that are readable, not overdone**<br>
Type expert John Kane recommends picking typefaces based on the
  * history of a font
  * the intended audience
  * the intended tone
  * the context in which the text is presented
<br>From [John Kane's A Type Primer](http://www.amazon.com/Type-Primer-2nd-John-Kane/dp/0205066445/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423750096&sr=8-1&keywords=type+primer), pg. 72

* **Use a max-width on text elements like `<p>` and `h-elements`** <br> Shoot for 50-75 characters per line, including punctuation and spaces.

* **Always style the following for text in CSS**:
    * `font-family`
    * `font-size`
    * `line-height`
    * `font-weight`
    * `color`

* **Unless it's a headline, _stop_ centering type** <br>
Centering type is for short lines, headlines, or French restaurant menus. If you're writing a paragraph, left alignment is best because each line starts at the same place, which let's reader read quickly.

* **Fonts on your computer, may not be on a user's. TEST TEST TEST** <br>

## Grids and Layout
* **Remember that users read left to right**<br> Consider that when designing a page and how elements are placed.

* **Use a grid system**
<br> Columns and math may seem tidious but it can really tie your site and it's content and elements together. Things will be systematic and not arbitrary choices. Also a grid isn't restricting, it actually opens up a lot of options.

* **Want something to stand out?**<br>
Break the grid! If something is supposed to pull people's attention? Offset it from the rest of the grid.
