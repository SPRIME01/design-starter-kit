## Color Theory
* **Use high contrast between colors**<br>
Consider a wider audience! A significant number of the population are color blind. Using high contrast colors helps _everyone_ read the content on your site.
  * [Test your color contrast](http://colorfilter.wickline.org/) <br>
  * [Test background and foreground text color](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)

* **Code fall-backs into color** <br>
If you decide to code a color with `rgba()`, include a fall-back above it which is a solid `rgb()` value for older browsers that can't read `rgba()`: <br>
  `color: rgb(12,15,134);`
  `color: rgba(12,15,134,.6);`

## Tips on Typography
* **Include line-height on all typographic elements**<br> `line-height` can completely change your site. Headlines should have a `line-height` of at least `1.2` or `1.3` and body copy (paragraphs and long reads) should have a `line-height` of at least `1.6` or `1.7`. <br>
`line-height: 1.6` can be applied to `body` css and then changed only when needed on individual type styles. <br>

* **Let the website design carry the tone, and pick typefaces that are readable, not overdone**<br>
Type expert John Kane recommends picking typefaces based on the
  * history of a font
  * the intended audience
  * the intended tone
  * the context in which the text is presented
<br>From [John Kane's A Type Primer](http://www.amazon.com/Type-Primer-2nd-John-Kane/dp/0205066445/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423750096&sr=8-1&keywords=type+primer), pg. 72

* **Use a max-width on text elements like `<p>` and `h-elements`** <br> Shoot for 50-75 characters per line, including punctuation and spaces.

* **Always style the following for text in CSS**:
    * `font-family`
    * `font-size`
    * `line-height`
    * `font-weight`
    * `color`

* **Unless it's a headline, _stop_ centering type** <br>
Centering type is for short lines, headlines, or French restaurant menus. If you're writing a paragraph, left alignment is best because each line starts at the same place, which let's reader read quickly.

## Hierarchy and Contrast
* **White space is your friend** <br>
It draws more attention to what is present. <br>
